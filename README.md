CustomToken Smart Contract
Overview
This repository contains the CustomToken smart contract, a simple implementation of an ERC-20-like token written in Solidity. It allows minting, transferring, and burning of tokens with basic functionalities.

Features
Token Details:
Name: CustomToken
Symbol: CTK
Decimals: 18
Ownership:
Only the contract owner can mint new tokens.
Key Functions:
mint(): Allows the owner to create new tokens.
transfer(): Enables transferring tokens between accounts.
burn(): Allows token holders to destroy their tokens.
balanceOf(): Retrieves the balance of a specific address.
Event Logging:
Transfer: Tracks token transfers.
Burn: Logs token burns.
Mint: Records token minting.
Prerequisites
Solidity: ^0.8.13
Blockchain Platform: Compatible with Ethereum-based platforms.
Development Environment: Any Solidity IDE or framework like Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle.
Deployment Instructions
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Compile the Contract:

Use Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle to compile the CustomToken.sol file.
Deploy the Contract:

Use a script or directly deploy from Remix.
Example (using Hardhat):
javascript
Copy code
const CustomToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("CustomToken");
const token = await CustomToken.deploy();
console.log("CustomToken deployed to:", token.address);
Set Up Owner Account:

The deploying address becomes the owner by default.
Usage
Mint Tokens
Only the owner can mint tokens.
Example:
solidity
Copy code
contractInstance.mint("0xRecipientAddress", 1000);
Transfer Tokens
Any user can transfer their tokens to another address.
Example:
solidity
Copy code
contractInstance.transfer("0xRecipientAddress", 500);
Burn Tokens
Token holders can burn their tokens to decrease the supply.
Example:
solidity
Copy code
contractInstance.burn(300);
Check Balance
Retrieve the token balance of an account:
solidity
Copy code
uint balance = contractInstance.balanceOf("0xAddress");
Security Notes
Ensure the contract is deployed to a trusted and secure network.
Use a multisig wallet for the owner address to enhance security.
Perform comprehensive testing before deploying to the mainnet.
